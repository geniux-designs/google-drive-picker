## Basic Usage

Wrap Your App with the Provider

Wrap your app with the GoogleDrivePickerProvider, passing in your clientId and apiKey.

```tsx
import { GoogleDrivePickerProvider } from '@geniux/google-drive-picker-react';

const App = () => (
  <GoogleDrivePickerProvider clientId="YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID" apiKey="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY">
    <YourComponent />
  </GoogleDrivePickerProvider>
);
```

### Using the Picker in Your Component

Use the useGoogleDrivePicker hook to open the Google Drive Picker and manage selected files.

```tsx
import { useGoogleDrivePicker } from '@geniux/google-drive-picker-react';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { openPicker, selectedFiles } = useGoogleDrivePicker({
    allowMultiSelect: true,
    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file'], // This scope is already default for the picker, but you can define others.
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={openPicker}>Open Google Drive Picker</button>
      <ul>
        {selectedFiles.map((file) => (
          <li key={file.id}>{file.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Next.js Compatibility

For Next.js users, you may encounter SSR (Server-Side Rendering) issues due to the way Next.js handles client-side scripts in packages that use barrel files (index files that re-export from multiple modules).

Since this package uses barrel files, it can lead to Next.js attempting to load client-specific scripts during SSR, resulting in errors or unintended behavior.

To mitigate this, add the following configuration to next.config.js. This setting tells Next.js to optimize the import of @geniux/google-drive-picker-react so that client-side modules are correctly handled as client-only, preventing SSR errors:

```js
// next.config.js|mjs|ts
module.exports = {
    experimental: {
        optimizePackageImports: ['@geniux/google-drive-picker-react'],
    },
};
```
With this configuration, Next.js will avoid attempting to load client-side scripts server-side, ensuring the Google scripts and Picker functionality load properly when rendered on the client.
